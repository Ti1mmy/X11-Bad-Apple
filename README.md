# X11-Bad-Apple
Bad Apple!! using X11 Graphics. Written in C++

## Demo (Realtime)

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ti1mmy/X11-Bad-Apple.git X11-Bad-Apple
cd X11-Bad-Apple/src
make

./X11-Bad-Apple
```
* Note that you will have to have X11 installed (and an X11 server running) for this to work.
    * On Ubuntu, you can install X11 with `sudo apt install libx11-dev`
    * I suggest Xming on Windows, but you can use any X11 server.
